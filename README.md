jackson
=======

Lots of times when we work on java system, we need to work with json. In AxisRooms i was working with Jackson but there we were using highly cusomizable serialize methods, which uesd to take lot of developement time. What i wanted to write Jacksone code so that i can easily work between Java-JSON, also i wanted this to be highly customizable i.e. can handle lots of Polymorphism. So this is the code to work with JSON.
